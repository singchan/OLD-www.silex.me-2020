section7: "<h2>The beauty of a static<br>drag and drop editor</h2><h3>Dolor ipsum</h3><p>Due
  to its static nature and the way elements are absolutely positioned, Silex is extremely
  simple yet powerful: no databases, no security issues, no limitations for the design.
  Plus it is free and open source so you own your data and get to choose where you
  store it while working on your website–on your Dropbox or Own Cloud or Next Cloud
  for their collaborative capabilities, on GitHub for the versioning or FTP or local
  file system. Most of these services are available online so you can work from anywhere,
  or use the desktop version to work offline. And finally, Silex generates websites
  which are so simple that you can host them for free with GitHub Pages, or push directly
  to any web host.</p>"
